 Retail Sales Data Analysis Using SQL  

Project Description  

This is a simple yet practical SQL project for analyzing retail sales data. It involves setting up two tables: **Products** and **Sales**, inserting sample data, and running analytical queries to gain insights into product performance and sales trends.


Project Features  

- SQL table creation using DDL  
- Data insertion using DML  
- Aggregate functions: `SUM()`, `AVG()`, `GROUP BY`  
- Filtering aggregated results with `HAVING`  
- Subqueries and ORDER BY clauses  
- JOIN operations for combining related tables  



 Tables Created  

- `Products`: Stores product details like name, category, and price  
- `Sales`: Tracks sales transactions, quantities sold, and sale dates  

Analytical Queries Answered  

Questions I answered with this project:

1. View all sales transactions with product names and total sale amount  
2. Find the total quantity sold and total revenue per product  
3. Calculate the average quantity sold per product  
4. List products with total revenue above 3,000  
5. Identify the product with the highest total sales revenue (using subquery and join method)
